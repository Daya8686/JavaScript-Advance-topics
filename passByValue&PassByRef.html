<!-- In this code we are going to see the pass by value and pass by refernce 
1. pass by value :under this we get only permitive data types like
String
Number
boolean
null
undefine

This are immutable that means we can not change this values 
Even Numbers, booleans and Strings we can't change
let a=10;
b=20;
console.log(a); //this will be 10 only
and this is also same for all the permitive data types
let str1="hello";
let str2=str1
 str1[0]="W";
console.log(str2) // hello this will not change 
Str1 print Wello and str2 print only hello because they just pass valuesnot link or reference or address

//THIS IS BECAUSE THIS WILL PASS THE VALUES


//-------------------------------------
PASS BY REFERENCE

Function 
Array
objects

This 3v are non-permititive data type they will internally change the address that is referance
